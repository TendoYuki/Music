<p id="titre">[Chorus]
<p id="aligne">She played the fiddle in an Irish band
<p id="aligne">But she fell in love with an English man
<p id="aligne">Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
<p id="aligne">Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

<p id="titre">[Verse 1]
<p id="aligne">I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
<p id="aligne">She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
<p id="aligne">She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
<p id="aligne">Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
<p id="aligne">She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
<p id="aligne">She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
<p id="aligne">Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
<p id="aligne">Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

<p id="titre">[Chorus]
<p id="aligne">You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
<p id="aligne">But she fell in love with an English man
<p id="aligne">Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
<p id="aligne">Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
<p id="aligne">With my pretty little Galway Girl
<p id="aligne">You're my pretty little Galway Girl

<p id="titre">[Verse 2]
<p id="aligne">You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
<p id="aligne">And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
<p id="aligne">As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
<p id="aligne">After dancing the c√©ili singing to trad tunes
<p id="aligne"><p id="aligne">I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
<p id="aligne">A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
<p id="aligne">Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
<p id="aligne">And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

<p id="titre">[Chorus]
<p id="aligne">You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
<p id="aligne">But she fell in love with an English man
<p id="aligne">Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
<p id="aligne">Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
<p id="aligne">My pretty little Galway Girl
<p id="aligne">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
<p id="aligne">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

<p id="titre">[Verse 3]
<p id="aligne">And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
<p id="aligne">I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
<p id="aligne">Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
<p id="aligne">As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
<p id="aligne">I walked her home then she took me inside
<p id="aligne">To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
<p id="aligne">I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
<p id="aligne">About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

<p id="titre">[Chorus]
<p id="aligne">She played the fiddle in an Irish band
<p id="aligne">But she fell in love with an English man
<p id="aligne">Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
<p id="aligne">Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
<p id="aligne">My pretty little Galway Girl
<p id="aligne">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
<p id="aligne">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
<p id="aligne">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
